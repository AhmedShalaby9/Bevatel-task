Chat and Travel Management Application
Project Overview


This project is a chat application that includes features such as user authentication (sign-up and login), real-time chat messaging, image upload, and travel management. The application leverages the BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern for state management and Firebase for backend services, including Firestore for database operations and Firebase Storage for image uploads.

Data Layer
Entities
Entities represent the structure of the data in the application. These are plain Dart classes.

chat_entity.dart: Defines the structure of a chat message.
user_entity.dart: Defines the structure of a user.
travel_entity.dart: Defines the structure of travel data.
Mappers
Mappers are responsible for transforming data between different layers, typically between entities and models.

auth_mapper.dart: Maps between UserEntity and UserModel.
chat_mapper.dart: Maps between ChatEntity and ChatModel.
travel_mapper.dart: Maps between TravelEntity and TravelModel.
Repositories
Repositories handle data operations and act as an intermediary between data sources and the rest of the app.

chat_repo_impl.dart: Implements methods to manage chat data, including fetching, adding, updating, and deleting chats.
user_repo_impl.dart: Implements methods to manage user data, including sign-up, login, and fetching users.
travels_repo.dart: Implements methods to manage travel data, including fetching, adding, updating, and deleting travel records.
Models
Models represent the data in a form that is used within the application, often aligned with domain logic.

chat_model.dart: Defines the structure of a chat message in the domain layer.
user_model.dart: Defines the structure of a user in the domain layer.
travel_model.dart: Defines the structure of travel data in the domain layer.
Domain Layer
Repositories
Interfaces for repositories that define the methods available for data operations.

i_chat_repo.dart: Interface for chat data operations.
i_user_repo.dart: Interface for user data operations.
i_travel_repo.dart: Interface for travel data operations.
Presentation Layer
BLoC (Business Logic Component)
Handles the state management for the application, managing events and states for different features.

auth_bloc.dart: Manages authentication-related events and states.
chat_bloc.dart: Manages chat-related events and states.
travel_bloc.dart: Manages travel-related events and states.
Events
Defines events that trigger changes in the BLoC.

auth_event.dart: Events related to user authentication.
chat_event.dart: Events related to chat operations.
travel_event.dart: Events related to travel operations.
States
Defines various states managed by the BLoC.

auth_state.dart: States related to user authentication.
chat_state.dart: States related to chat operations.
travel_state.dart: States related to travel operations.
Screens
Defines the UI screens of the application.

login_screen.dart: Screen for user login.
signup_screen.dart: Screen for user sign-up.
chats_screen.dart: Screen displaying a list of chat users.
chat_details_screen.dart: Screen displaying details of a specific chat conversation.
travels_screen.dart: Screen displaying a list of travel records.
travel_details_screen.dart: Screen displaying details of a specific travel record.
Widgets
Reusable UI components.

chat_card_item.dart: Widget for displaying a chat card item.
message_card.dart: Widget for displaying a chat message.
pick_image_button.dart: Widget for picking an image.
record_audio_button.dart: Widget for recording audio.
send_message_button.dart: Widget for sending a message.
custom_back_button.dart: Custom back button widget.
custom_network_image.dart: Widget for displaying images from a network source.
loader.dart: Loading spinner widget.
rounded_button.dart: Widget for a customizable rounded button.
Constants
Defines constants used throughout the application.

app_colors.dart: Defines color constants.
image_paths.dart: Defines paths to image assets.
lang_keys.dart: Defines language keys for localization.
text_themes.dart: Defines text styles.
Helper
Helper classes for various utility functions.

navigation/: Handles navigation within the app.
navigation.dart: Navigation helper functions.
router.dart: Defines the app router.
routes.dart: Defines the app routes.
local_storage/: Handles local storage operations.
local_storage.dart: Local storage helper functions.
shared_preferences.dart: Manages shared preferences.
form_validation/: Form validation helpers.
form_validation.dart: Functions for validating forms.
Usage
Setting Up Firebase
Ensure you have Firebase set up for your project by adding the necessary configurations in your pubspec.yaml and initializing Firebase in your main entry file.

Running the Application
To run the application, use the following command:

sh
Copy code
flutter run
Ensure you have a connected device or emulator.

Authentication
Users can sign up and log in using their email and password. The authentication state is managed using the AuthBloc.

Chat Functionality
Users can send and receive chat messages in real-time. The chat state is managed using the ChatBloc. Images can be uploaded, and chats are reloaded to reflect new messages or images.

Travel Management
Users can manage travel records, including adding, updating, and deleting travels. The travel state is managed using the TravelBloc.

Offline-First Functionality
The application is designed to work seamlessly offline. Data is cached locally and synced with Firestore when a connection is available.

Data Synchronization
Data synchronization is handled automatically by Firebase. Changes made while offline are synced with Firestore once the device is back online.

Architecture Description
The project follows clean architecture principles, separating the project into three main layers:

Presentation Layer: Handles the UI and state management.
Domain Layer: Contains business logic and models.
Data Layer: Manages data retrieval and storage, including local storage and network requests.
Assumptions and Decisions
Firebase is used for real-time database functionality and image storage.
The BLoC pattern is used for state management to ensure a clear separation of concerns and maintainability.
Hive or Isar is used for local storage to support offline-first functionality.
